  To do this, open the file overview and click on ‘Settings’ in the left-hand column.
* [Owncloud](https://owncloud.com/): `https://<your-owncloud-domain>/remote.php/webdav/`
* [Hetzner Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box): `https://<username>.your-storagebox.de`
* [Strato HiDrive](https://www.strato.de/): `https://webdav.hidrive.strato.com`
* [Seafile](https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/extension/webdav/): `https://<your-seafile-domain>/seafdav` if you are running your Seafile behind a reverse proxy, make sure to add the relevant port, by default WebDAV serves at port 8080.
* [Beeline Cloud](https://cloudbeeline.ru/): `https://webdav.cloudbeeline.ru` – free 10GB (forever), to enable WebDAV – navigate to Profile → Security and toggle the setting (screenshots and [detailed explanation here](https://t.me/another_mvp/49)).

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

### To remove an integration instance from Home Assistant

1. Go to [**Settings** > **Devices & services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/) and select the integration card.
2. From the list of devices, select the integration instance you want to remove.
3. Next to the entry, select the three-dot `[mdi:dots-vertical]` menu. Then, select **Delete**.

* If you remove the integration, the backup folder is not automatically deleted. You have to manually delete it.

## Known issues / limitations

Due to the nature of WebDAV, it is required to have a fairly high file upload limit on the server.
If you experience issues with the backup, please check the server configuration or with your WebDAV service provider.

Following WebDAV services are known to have issues with Home Assistant backups:

* Yandex Disk is not supported, as the speed is artificially slowed down when using WebDAV.
* pCloud WebDAV implementation proved to be unstable and is not recommended for backups.
