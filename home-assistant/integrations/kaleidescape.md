# Kaleidescape

The **Kaleidescape** integration allows for the automation of [Kaleidescape](https://www.kaleidescape.com/) movie players.

Ideas for automation include:

* Playing and pausing a movie sets lighting scenes.
* The start of movie credits turns up the lights.
* A change in aspect ratio controls a projection masking system.
* A change in video resolution controls a lens system or video scaler.

## Supported Models

This integration is intended for the automation of Kaleidescape players with a movie zone. This includes all Strato and Premier players. Strato players support auto-discovery in Home Assistant. Premier players must be added manually by adding an instance of this integration and specifying the IP address of the player.

## Media player

The Kaleidescape media player platform will create a [media player](/home-assistant/integrations/media_player/index.md) entity for the device. This entity will display the currently playing media and playback controls.

## Remote

The Kaleidescape remote platform will create a [Remote](/home-assistant/integrations/remote/index.md) entity for the device. This entity allows you to send the following commands via the [remote.send\_command](/home-assistant/integrations/remote/index.md) action.

* `select`
* `up`
* `down`
* `left`
* `right`
* `cancel`
* `replay`
* `scan_forward`
* `scan_reverse`
* `go_movie_covers`
* `menu_toggle`

A typical action might look like the example below, which sends a command to the device to *select* the currently highlighted item.

```yaml
action: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.kaleidescape_theater
data:
  command:
    - select
```

## Sensor

Additional details about the values provided by the sensors can be found in Kaleidescape's [Control Protocol Reference Manual](https://www.kaleidescape.com/wp-content/uploads/Kaleidescape-System-Control-Protocol-Reference-Manual.pdf).

A typical automation might look like the example below, which turns up the lights when the *media\_location* sensor leaves the *content* state.

```yaml
- alias: "Kaleidescape theater lights up"
  triggers:
    - trigger: state
      entity_id: sensor.kaleidescape_theater_media_location
      from: content
  actions:
    - action: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.theater_lights
```
