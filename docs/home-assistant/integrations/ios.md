# Home Assistant iOS

The **Home Assistant iOS** integration is used by the Home Assistant Companion App for iOS to store and provide settings for [actionable notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/actionable-notifications) and [actions](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/actions). Both of these can also be configured for a single device within the app, in which case the `ios` integration is not required.

For further details please check the [Companion App Documentation Site](https://companion.home-assistant.io).
