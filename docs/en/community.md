- ✅ **Specify your identity** (Business/Individual)  
  *Note: Businesses are organizations or companies making profit from Home Assistant as a commercial product*

> ⚠️ **Notice:**  
From past experience: to avoid people joining only to solve a quick problem (and then going inactive, splitting true communicators into separate groups), a joining threshold has been added to the "Advanced Users Group" to ensure only people genuinely interested in communicating are in the group.

## 📚 Community Guidelines

> **Please read and follow these rules carefully to help build a harmonious, orderly, and professional community.**

---

### 🏷️ 1. Group Nickname Rule

- <span style="color:#15803d">**Format: Nickname (Device Model + System Version)**</span>
    - For example: Xiaowang (NUC11 + HAOS), Laowang (Box + Docker)
- <span style="color:#64748b">For businesses, manufacturers, or installers:</span> You can set your nickname as your shop name or a custom nickname, e.g. "Xiaowang Shop (NUC11 + HAOS)", "Laowang Company (Box + Docker)"

---

### 🗣️ 2. Topic Management

- 🚫 Strictly forbidden to discuss illegal or prohibited topics, including but not limited to politics, religion, pornography, violence, terrorism, racism, etc.
- 🌐 Avoid sharing links inaccessible from mainland China—never directly send such content in the group
- ⚖️ Do not discuss gray area topics (like packet sniffing, reverse engineering, simulated logins, data scraping, etc.), compliance is required

---

### ❓ 3. Asking Questions

- 🤗 This group does not answer basic questions; for basics, see resources listed in rule 6. If you won’t read documentation, you won’t get answers here either.
- 📝 When asking, please provide a complete, clear question description
- 🙏 Be polite, thank those who help
- 📖 Please check if your question is already answered in the public account; repeated questions may not be addressed
- 🖥️ For logs, please use desktop screenshots or upload log files—don’t spam logs as text messages

---

### 🎁 4. Sharing & Promotion

- 👍 Sharing quality user experiences of products is welcomed
- 🤝 For group buying links, **ask first if anyone needs**, and provide: original price, group-buy price, spots to complete, product intro when asking
- 🚫 Direct advertising is not allowed; first offense is a warning, repeated offenders will be removed
- 🛒 If members need relevant products that you have, moderate recommendations are OK
- 🏷️ Don’t trash any brand—remain objective and neutral. Use "X" or similar instead of specific brand names.
- 💰 If selling your own products, ask if there's demand, and group price must not exceed public platform price
- 🧪 Manufacturers/merchants needing player evaluations: first ask if anyone wants to participate, then post details if yes. Test products should be free and do not need to be returned; abusing this (refusing to test or freeloading) will get you removed
- 💼 If manufacturers need paid services, state the price clearly and respect the group’s efforts—do not try to get free or ultra-cheap labor

---

### 🤗 5. Civil Communication

- 🚷 Absolutely no personal attacks, including but not limited to gender, age, occupation, region, religion, sexual orientation; all forms of discrimination and insult will not be tolerated

---

### ⏳ 6. Question Response

- 💬 All help is voluntary, answers are not required to be responsible for your issues
- 🕰️ If you don’t get a prompt reply, please be patient—members may be busy or your question may lack clarity
- 🤖 The official account has an AI assistant for support—you’re encouraged to ask it first; if it cannot help, then ask in the group
- 📚 <span id="related-knowledge-base">Knowledge Base & Resources:</span> [HA and Peripheral Knowledge Base](https://ima.qq.com/wiki/?shareId=65fd12acb33dba9197c9134e5bd00f703cce40a7d973dc52b76a347dee22e15f)

### 🚪 7. Add/Remove Member Rules

- 🔒 The group does not accept invitations; only natural applicants are added
- 👋 Those who only follow to join the group and unfollow afterwards will be removed
- ⚠️ Violating the rules results in immediate removal
- 🤖 Managed by bot; forbidden to send non-compliant content (e.g. mini-apps, voice/video messages, chat log forwards, messages longer than 80 lines, or spamming 10+ messages in 10 seconds, etc.)
- 🧹 When the group is full, removal will be random based on activity and compliance with announcements; priority removal for those who didn't complete the agreement/don't agree to announcements → didn’t modify nickname → didn’t follow the official account → never spoke
